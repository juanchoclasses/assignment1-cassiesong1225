### Things that you noticed
- Did the variable names make sense?
    Yes, the variable names my teammate used does make sense. She basically continued to use the variable name given in the start code, which already has been made very clear and simple what it stands for.
    For example:
    _errorOccured indicates whether an error has occurred during formula evaluation.
    _currentFormula stores the formula currently being evaluated.
    _sheetMemory represents the memory of the sheet where the cells are stored.
- Is the code functional?
    Yes, this code It defines a FormulaEvaluator class with methods to evaluate mathematical formulas in the context of a spreadsheet, considering cell references and handling errors. She uses a Recursive Descent Parsing algorithm to evaluate arithmetic expressions.An arithmetic expression is generally defined in terms of a grammar that outlines how operators and operands can be combined. Recursive Descent Parsing is a top-down parsing technique that starts with the highest-level grammar rule (in this case, an expression) and works its way down, recursively breaking down the rules until it reaches the lowest-level grammar rules.
- Are the comments readable?
    Yes, the comments are readable. They provide useful context and explanations for the functionality of methods and what each part of the code does. For instance, the comment for the expression method clearly explains its purpose: "Evaluate an arithmetic expression and return the result."
- Are the function names self-explanatory?
    Yes, the function names are self-explanatory and suggest their intended functionality:
    evaluate: Evaluates the mathematical formula.
    expression: Evaluates an arithmetic expression.
    term: Evaluates a term within the arithmetic expression.
    factor: Evaluates a factor within the arithmetic expression.
